{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of your software}
As a software engineer, I am continuously exploring new ways to enhance my programming skills and deepen my understanding of core concepts. For this project, I have created a simple yet personalized "Hello, World!" program to reinforce my knowledge of Python programming and build a foundation for more complex applications in the future.

{Describe your purpose for creating this software.}
The purpose of this software is to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts, including function creation, string manipulation, and basic I/O operations. By building this project, I am refining my ability to write clean, maintainable code and establishing good habits in documenting and presenting my work. This exercise is also part of my ongoing effort to experiment with different programming paradigms, aiming for flexibility and adaptability in future projects.



{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
